Satellite Constellation Visualisation

Usage:
	./test -n<num>
 where <num> is the number of satellites.

Currently only has one constellation design, with three equally-spaced orbital
 planes, and mean anomalies suited to an even number of sats per plane.  (If
 you want to model a different design, change the code!)
With n = 6, all sats share a common plane, which rotates twice per orbit.
With n = 12, there are two such planes, 180° apart.

Sat visibility is based on an orbital altitude of 4170km, chosen because it
 gives an orbital period of 10770.5s, one eighth of a sidereal day.

The range calculation is based on the root model and assumes a base sat range
 of 12Mm.  So, for a target range of r km, the effective range in km is
	r + sqrt(12000 * r)
This assumes r < 12000, as the root model is properly
	min(r + R) + sqrt(rR)
 but in practice if r > 12000 then we will be horizon-limited anyway.

Keys:
 r	Toggle [r]unning animation
 z	Toggle display of coverage [z]ones
 m	Write [m]inimum latitude without coverage to stdout.  Requires coverage
	 zones to be enabled.
 0	Reset time to t = 0.
 -/+	Decrease/increase target range.  Writes new range and effective range
	 to stdout.  Step is 1000km (or 100km if Ctrl held).
 left/right cursor keys
	Step time back/forwards
 down/up cursor keys
	Decrease/increase orbital inclination, in 0.4° steps.
 q	Quit.
